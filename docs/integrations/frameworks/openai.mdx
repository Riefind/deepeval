## Quick Summary

DeepEval streamlines the process of evaluating your OpenAI applications with just a few lines of code.

## End-to-End Evaluation

To begin evaluating your OpenAI application, simply attach the `@observe` decorator to your LLM application, and replace your OpenAI client with DeepEval's OpenAI client.

```python
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
from deepeval.dataset import Golden
from deepeval.openai import OpenAI

@observe(metrics=[AnswerRelevancyMetric()])
def llm_app(input: str):
    client = OpenAI()
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": input}
        ]
    )

evaluate(observed_callback=llm_app, goldens=[Golden("Hello, how are you?")])
```
